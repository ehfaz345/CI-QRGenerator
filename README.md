# Codeigniter QR code generator

**The CI library being used here is not something that I created, rather, it is a
project by dwisetiyadi. The link to the original project can be found here - [Link](https://github.com/dwisetiyadi/CodeIgniter-PHP-QR-Code)**

The purpose of this repository is to depict the complete usage of the library (again, more can be found on the original developer's page) as done by myself and also to act as a future guide for myself and my colleagues, should the need ever rise.

## Usage

**Steps**
1. Copy the files into the directory application > libraries
2. Load the library into the controller using "$this->load->library(ciqrcode)"
3. Use the example shown in the "Controllers" folder to generate the QR code and download a PNG of it
